Story Sprout contract evaluation v3 - HELD-OUT VERIFICATION SUITE.
Authored 2026-07-23, AFTER model selection, on the paper side. All-new cases;
same case-type distribution as the development suite (including a ~10%
replacement subset - excluding the known-hard category would be reverse-tuning).
Runs the FROZEN final configuration only, REPS times (stochastic honesty).
The development suite (evaluations/scribe_contract/scribe_eval_v2.py) is hereafter the model-selection
evaluation; this suite supplies the reported verification numbers.
DO NOT MODIFY SEQUENCES OR SCORING. Claude Code implements call_model only.
